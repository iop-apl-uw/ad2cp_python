#
# The ADCP supplied plotting routines in MissionOcean use the basestation
# sections.yml file to define what portions of the mission are plotted.
# The adcp variables to plot are specified in the "adcp_variables"
# dictionary (instead the "variables" dictionary).  The only options supported are
# "start", "stop", "flip" "colormap", "top" and "bottom" - other options are ignored.
#
# All other parts of the sections.yml file are common with the basestation default processing
#

# Supported ADCP variables are listed here
adcp_variables:
  # Specifying either ad2cp_inv_profile_vocn or ad2cp_inv_profile_uocn will produce the same plot
  ad2cp_inv_profile_vocn: { top: 0, bottom: 1000, colormap: balance, min: -1, max: 1 }
